An optical phonon at 2.5 meV is observed in a thin film of the chiral metal halide (R-MBA)PbI, but is absent in the racemic counterpart, as revealed by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. This experimental result indicates the chiral origin of the 2.5 meV mode and supports recent theoretical predictions of chirality transfer from the organic to the inorganic layers, with implications for the spin polarization properties of hybrid metal halides and perovskites.
