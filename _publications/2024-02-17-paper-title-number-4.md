ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized by sol-gel method. Zinc acetate dehydrate and monoethanolamine (MEA) were used as the precursor materials. The Zinc Oxide (ZnO) thin films were prepared by spin coating technique. The obtained films were further calcined at 500°C. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique was used to characterize the thin films. The XRD spectra indicate that the ZnO crystal has a hexagonal wurtzite structure. The grain size of 16nm was obtained from the analysis of XRD pattern. The wettability of thin film was determined by measuring the contact angle. A custom made electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) plasma was used to study its effect on the surface modification of ZnO thin film. The ZnO thin film was treated with Ar-plasma for 20 min. The plasma treatment resulted in the surface modification of ZnO thin films which was observed from the changes in the contact angle measurement.
