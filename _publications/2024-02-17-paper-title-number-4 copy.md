The presented work is focused on the study of nanocomposites consisting of Fe3O4 nanoparticles, Mesoporous Carbon (MC) and reduced Graphene Oxide (rGO) as nanofillers in non-conducting polymer (Polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)) matrix for Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) shielding applications. PVDF polymer nanocomposites have been prepared using solution casting process and these composites are carefully characterized. The dielectric, magnetic, conducting, thermal, mechanical and wettability properties are studied using various tools. Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) showing the probable conjugation. Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) confirms the thermal stability of the composites and EMI shielding effectiveness is carried out using Vector Network Analyzer. Promising platform using mesoporous based materials for high performance coatings, is hence demonstrated through this presentation.
