# Welcome

Iâ€™m **Pratik Bhagwat**, an MSc student in **Photonics at Lund University**, with a previous MSc in Physics from SP Pune University. My academic journey has been shaped by a deep interest in **optics, photonics, and the analytical methods of physics**, and Iâ€™m motivated by the challenge of applying rigorous scientific thinking to both research and broader problemâ€‘solving.

My current focus lies in **photonics research**, where I explore the interaction of light and matter, and the technologies that emerge from it. Beyond my academic work, Iâ€™m also interested in **language, writing, and creative expression**, and I plan to expand this site into a space that reflects both my scientific and creative pursuits.
