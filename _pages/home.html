# Welcome to My Academic Homepage

Hello, I’m **Pratik Bhagwat** — a physicist and photonics researcher currently pursuing my MSc in **Photonics at Lund University, Sweden**.  
My work explores the **interaction of light and matter**, with a focus on **ultrafast spectroscopy, nanomaterials, and photonic technologies**.

## 🔬 Current Research
I am completing my Master’s thesis at the Division of Chemical Physics, Lund University, where I investigate **time-resolved exciton and spin dynamics in chiral 2D perovskites**. This project combines:
- **Ultrafast pump–probe spectroscopy**  
- **Nanomaterials synthesis and thin-film fabrication**  
- **Advanced data analysis** using Python and Surface Xplorer  
- **Spin–phonon interactions** and exciton dynamics  

This research builds on my earlier work in **nanocomposites for EMI shielding** and **ZnO thin films for self-cleaning applications**, creating a trajectory that bridges **materials science, optics, and applied physics**.
