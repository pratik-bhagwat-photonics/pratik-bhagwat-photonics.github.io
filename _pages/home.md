## 🔬 Current Research

I am completing my Master’s thesis at Lund University’s Division of Chemical Physics:
**Time‑resolved exciton and spin dynamics in chiral 2D perovskites.**

This project combines:
- Ultrafast pump–probe spectroscopy
- Nanomaterials synthesis and thin‑film fabrication
- Advanced data analysis (Python, Surface Xplorer)
- Spin–phonon interactions and exciton dynamics
